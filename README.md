# Excel-Data-Visualization-Sales-Project

Using sales data I was able to create a dashboard in Microsoft Excel to showcase the total amount of sales by region within company. 

Graph 1 which is a bar chart allows user to sort by the amount of each product sold per region using a slicer. It also allows user to sort by order type, retail & wholesale.
Graph 2 which is a pie chart allows user to see the percentage of products sold by categories and by individual products by each region.
